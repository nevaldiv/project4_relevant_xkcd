##Which is the Relevant XKCD?

born out of the internet-famous saying that:  

>  __There is a relevant XKCD for every 
>  situation__

The intention of the app was to be a lighthearted app/attempt to help 
users find that relevant comic.  Or when its on the tip of their tongue
and they know it exists but cant quite find it.

Or if they simply wanted to waste some time reading some good comics   
(aside: short comics as a theme not was entirely NOT conducive to productivity, ha).

the result, was of course, my first MEAN stack app:

##Challenges

####Search
Search is particularily hard to do simply because of the fact that
when dealing with 'relevancy' or search results, you quite simply will never outdo google,
or if you do, well then you would be pretty rich.  BUT IM NOT (...yet ^^), see, so life goes on
and I do the next best thing, filters!
